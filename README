To compile this project the edit the pom.xml file, pointing the variable "cplex.jar.path" 
to the location of the CPLEX jar in your file system.

CPLEX bindings will only work if CPLEX is installed in your system 
(the jar file is enough to compile the code, but not enough for the bindings to work).
